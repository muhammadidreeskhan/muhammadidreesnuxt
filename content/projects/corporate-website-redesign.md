## Development Process

The project began with a comprehensive audit of the existing website, identifying pain points, outdated content, and performance issues. We conducted stakeholder interviews and user research to understand the needs of both the client and their customers.

The design phase focused on creating a professional, trustworthy aesthetic that would appeal to the financial services clientele while making information easy to find and understand. We created detailed wireframes and high-fidelity mockups, which were reviewed and refined with client feedback.

Development followed a component-based approach, building reusable blocks that the client could easily customize through the WordPress editor. We implemented strict performance budgets and accessibility requirements throughout the build process.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Complex Information Architecture

The client had accumulated years of content with inconsistent organization and navigation.

**Solution**: Conducted a content audit and card sorting exercises with stakeholders to create a logical, user-centered information architecture. Implemented breadcrumbs, related content suggestions, and an enhanced search function to help users find information.

### Challenge 2: Performance with Rich Media

The design required high-quality imagery and interactive elements while maintaining fast load times.

**Solution**: Implemented lazy loading, next-gen image formats (WebP with fallbacks), responsive images, and critical CSS delivery. Set up a CDN and browser caching for optimal delivery, achieving a 90+ PageSpeed score on both mobile and desktop.

### Challenge 3: Content Management for Non-Technical Staff

The client needed an easy way for staff to update content without technical knowledge.

**Solution**: Created custom Gutenberg blocks that matched their specific content needs, with predefined styles and options. Developed comprehensive documentation and conducted training sessions for the content team.

The website redesign has delivered significant improvements:

- 62% increase in average time on site
- 45% reduction in bounce rate
- 38% increase in lead generation form submissions
- 28% improvement in mobile conversion rate
- 95% satisfaction rating from internal stakeholders
