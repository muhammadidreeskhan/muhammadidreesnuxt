# Getting Started with Nuxt 3: A Complete Guide

Nuxt 3 represents a significant evolution in the Vue.js ecosystem, offering developers a powerful framework for building modern web applications. Whether you're new to Vue or a seasoned developer looking to leverage the latest features, this guide will help you get started with Nuxt 3 and understand its key capabilities.

## What is Nuxt 3?

Nuxt 3 is a meta-framework built on top of Vue 3, designed to provide an intuitive and powerful way to create web applications. It offers a variety of rendering modes, including server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and client-side rendering, allowing developers to choose the best approach for their specific use case.

Key features of Nuxt 3 include:

- **Vue 3 and Composition API**: Built on the latest version of Vue with full support for the Composition API
- **Nitro Engine**: A powerful new server engine that enables cross-platform deployment
- **Vite Integration**: Lightning-fast development experience with Vite
- **TypeScript Support**: Built from the ground up with TypeScript
- **Hybrid Rendering**: Mix and match SSR, SSG, and CSR as needed
- **Auto-imports**: Automatic imports for components, composables, and Vue APIs

## Setting Up Your First Nuxt 3 Project

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- Node.js (v16.0.0 or newer)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm for package management

### Creating a New Project

The easiest way to create a new Nuxt 3 project is using the official starter template:

```bash
# Using npx
npx nuxi init my-nuxt-app

# Using yarn
yarn dlx nuxi init my-nuxt-app

# Using pnpm
pnpm dlx nuxi init my-nuxt-app
```

Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd my-nuxt-app
npm install
```

### Starting the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Nuxt development server, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Understanding the Nuxt 3 Project Structure

A typical Nuxt 3 project has the following structure:

```
my-nuxt-app/
├── .nuxt/           # Build directory (auto-generated)
├── assets/          # Uncompiled assets like SCSS, images
├── components/      # Vue components
├── composables/     # Composable functions
├── content/         # Content files (if using @nuxt/content)
├── layouts/         # Layout components
├── middleware/      # Navigation middleware
├── pages/           # Application pages and routes
├── plugins/         # JavaScript plugins
├── public/          # Static files served at root path
├── server/          # Server-side code
├── app.vue          # Main application component
├── nuxt.config.ts   # Nuxt configuration file
└── package.json     # Project dependencies and scripts
```

## Key Concepts in Nuxt 3

### Pages and Routing

Nuxt 3 uses file-based routing. Simply create `.vue` files in the `pages/` directory, and Nuxt will automatically generate routes based on the file structure:

```
pages/
├── index.vue        # / route
├── about.vue        # /about route
└── users/
    ├── index.vue    # /users route
    └── [id].vue     # /users/:id route
```

### Components

Components in Nuxt 3 are automatically imported when used in your templates, eliminating the need for explicit imports:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <MyComponent />
  </div>
</template>
```

Just place your components in the `components/` directory, and Nuxt will handle the rest.

### Data Fetching

Nuxt 3 provides several composables for data fetching:

```vue
<script setup>
// Fetch data on the server side (SSR) or during static generation (SSG)
const { data } = await useFetch('/api/posts')

// Fetch data on the client side
const { data: posts } = await useLazyFetch('/api/posts')
</script>
```

### State Management

Nuxt 3 includes built-in state management with `useState`:

```vue
<script setup>
const counter = useState('counter', () => 0)

function increment() {
  counter.value++
}
</script>
```

## Deploying Your Nuxt 3 Application

Nuxt 3 supports various deployment targets:

### Static Site (SSG)

Generate a static version of your site:

```bash
npm run generate
```

This creates a `.output/public` directory that can be deployed to any static hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

### Server Rendering (SSR)

For server-side rendering, build your application:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then start the production server:

```bash
npm run start
```

Nuxt 3's Nitro server can be deployed to various platforms including Node.js servers, serverless functions, and edge computing platforms.

## Conclusion

Nuxt 3 offers a powerful and flexible framework for building modern web applications with Vue 3. Its intuitive API, performance optimizations, and versatile rendering options make it an excellent choice for projects of all sizes.
